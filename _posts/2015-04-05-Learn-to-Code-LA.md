#### Learn to Code La
    Ever wanted to learn how to code?  Are you in LA?  Well then join me!  I host an open study session on Thursdays for [Learn to Code LA](http://www.meetup.com/LearnToCodeLA).  I'm also an assistant orginizer and admin for our [Slack](http://learntocodela.slack.com).  We're growing a community of people to learn and teach coding.  Interested in participating?  Join the meetup for more information!
