I'm Ryan. I make a living engineering cloudy web technolgy for business people.  HR and tech recruiters call it [devops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DEToXsgrPc).  I don't think either of those groups has ever watched that video so who knows how they define that term.  

Sometimes I play music on guitar or go on adventures when I feel like heeding the call.  Othertimes I'm playing Blizzard's games in my boxers on a Saturday morning.  I always wanted to be a standup comedian,  I endorse social programs when they effectively help maginalized groups, and I think personality tests are silly: I'm an INTP.

Credentials are silly too.  Here are some of mine:

Github

LinkedIn

Cal Poly Pomona - Philosophy

YouTube - Music

Medium
