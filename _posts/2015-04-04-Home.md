# Ryan Morten
I'm Awesinine! I do make a living doing stuff with technolgy and business people.  I like to think of myself as a systems engineer but the buzzword we all use is something something [devops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DEToXsgrPc).  Sometimes I play music on piano and guitar or go on adventures when I feel like heeding the call.  I always wanted to be a standup comedian.  Personality tests are silly: I'm an INTP

##Credentials are silly too.  Here are some of mine:

Github
LinkedIn
Cal Poly Pomona - Philosophy
YouTube - Music
