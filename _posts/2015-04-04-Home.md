I'm Ryan. I make a living doing engineering using technolgy for business people.  Some people call it  [devops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DEToXsgrPc), but those people mostly work in HR =D.  

Sometimes I play music on piano and guitar or go on adventures when I feel like heeding the call.  I always wanted to be a standup comedian.  Personality tests are silly: I'm an INTP.

Credentials are silly too.  Here are some of mine:

Github

LinkedIn

Cal Poly Pomona - Philosophy

YouTube - Music
